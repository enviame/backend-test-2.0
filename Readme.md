# Enviame's Backend Test

This test requires the design and development of two communicated microservices: 
* ecommerce marketplace system.
* shipping & Tracking service.

The project is focused in the logistics aspect of a typical ecommerce process. That means you should make assumptions in other processes like payment or billing.

## Tech requirements
You must choose one of the follow languajes + frameworks.
- Python + flask
- NodeJS + express
- You must use Docker with Compose to provide a portable containerized app.
- APIs provided must have an authorization mechanism and it could be any of them: API Key, Bearer Token, Basic Auth, OAuth

If you're not familiar with Docker We already provide a template [here](https://github.com/enviame/backend-test-2.0/tree/main/docker-python). The template was structured following the principles defined by [clean architecture]

We encourage you to use the provided template, and we will reward you with extra points for two reasons: Reading code written by another dev is a necessary skill, understanding of clean architecture principles are desirable.

The template provides mysql, firestore, redis databases out-of-the-box. Be free to use any of them or any combination of them.

## Deadline
The test must be delivered in one week (7 days)

## Before you begin

- Provide a **private GitHub repository** with your code and add the following users as collaborators: **@rolivagon @rsebjara @vmolina-enviame @vham @rcarrascop**
- You must provide two containerized microservices with the proper instructions to run the app. Please don't forget to include:
    - Readme.md file with instructions on how to run your app
    - Postman collection or a req.http file with examples and instructions on how to test all the endpoints of your app
    - Enviroment file example (.env.example) with all the enviroment variables needed
    - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml with all the settings and containers needed to run your solution
- Please make sure to test your app in a clean environment and right from the start, because **if we can't run it, your test will be discarded inmediately** and it would be disappointing for all of us.
- As a backend test is not required to provide any view, quite the opposite we encourage You to provide an API where we could test all the features.

In case of any technical questions [Contact Us](mailto:tech-test@enviame.io)

Once we start reviewing your app we might send you some questions, therefore we will appreciate your timely replies.

## User Stories

### ecommerce microservice
1. As a "Marketplace Administrator" you may create, view, edit, delete and list "stores". Each store requires: name, short description and at least one "Seller User".
2. As a "Seller User" you may view and edit store information, and you must add a warehouse address as a previous condition to sell a product.
3. As a "Seller User" you may create, view, edit, edit, delete and list "products". Each product requires at least: name, short description and quantity.
4. As an "Internet User", you may register as a "Marketplace User". Each marketplace user requires at least: email and shipping_addres.
5. As a "Marketplace User", you may buy products of different stores. Your purchase couldn't exceed the stock of a product, and immediately reduce the available stock of the products according your purchase. In case the purchase exceed the stock of a product, the transacction will not be accepted.
6. As a "Seller User", you may list and view your "buy orders". You may change the order's status from "created" to "confirmed", and from "confirmed" to "dispatched". Each order must have: product sku, product quantity and delivery information. When you change an order to dispatched status, the ecommerce microservice notify the delivery microservice through delivery creation endpoint provided by the delivery microservice api.
7. As a "Marketplace User", you may "cancell" an order only if the status is "created" or "confirmed". In case an order is cancelled the available stock of the products must be increased.
8. As a "Marketplace Administrator", you may list, view and "cancell" orders.
9. As any kind of user you must see the current status of an order. The posible statuses are: "created", "confirmed", "dispached" and "delivered". The "delivered" status is triggered by the delivery microservices trough a webhook. That means the ecommerce microservice must provide an authenticated endpoint what will be registered in other microservices to notify when an order is delivered (or any other delivery status of an oder)


### delivery microservice

1. The delivery microservice must provide an authenticated API that allows create, view, edit and delete a delivery. The functionality to get the status history (tracking) of a delivery must provided as well.

- The contract to create a delivery could be like this example:
**request:**
```json
{
    "order":
    {
        "foreing_order_id": "order number provided by ecommerce microservice",
        "products": [{
                "sku": "unique id of product",
                "name": "product name",
                "qty": "product quantity"
            }]
    },
    "origin": {
        "address": "pickup address"
    },
    "destination": {
        "name": "customer name",
        "address": "customer address"
    }
}
```

**response:**
```json
{
    "order":
    {
        "foreing_order_id": "order number provided by ecommerce microservice",
        "products": [{
                "sku": "unique id of product",
                "name": "product name",
                "qty": "product quantity"
            }]
    },
    "origin": {
        "address": "pickup address"
    },
    "destination": {
        "name": "customer name",
        "address": "customer address"
    },
    "tracking_number": "provided by the delivery microservice",
    "status": "provided by the delivery microservice"
}
```

- The contract to get the delivery tracking history could be like this example:
**request:**
```json
{
    "foreing_order_id": "",
    "tracking_number": ""
}
```

**response:**
```json
{
    "tracking_number": "",
    "status": "",
    "tracking": [{
        "status": "",
        "date": ""
    }]
}
```

2. The delivery microservice must provide a mechanism to change the status of all orders each 30 seconds, following the next rules:
    - The order of the statuses are: "READY_FOR_PICK_UP" -> "AT_ORIGIN" -> "EN_ROUTE_OF_DELIVERY".
    - From "EN_ROUTE_OF_DELIVERY" there are 50% of probability to change to "NOT_DELIVERED" or "DELIVERED" (randomly).
    - From "NOT_DELIVERED" the order return to "EN_ROUTE_OF_DELIVERY". 
    - The "DELIVERED" status is a final status.

3. The delivery microservice must provide a service to register an endpoint to receiving notifications of changes in the status of an order (using webhooks). Each status must be notified only one time. 

### Definitions:
The statuses of a delivery are: **"READY_FOR_PICK_UP", "AT_ORIGIN", "EN_ROUTE_OF_DELIVERY", "NOT_DELIVERED", "DELIVERED".**

## Aspects to be evaluated

It is important that you write a readme.md with all the necessary instructions on how to run your services and a postman collection or a req.http file with examples and instructions on how to properly test them. Please include examples. If the readme is incorrect and we can't run and test your services, we will not be able to review them.

- Functionality (36 pts)
- Unit tests (12 pts)
- Documentation (6 pts)
    - Readme.md file with instructions on how to run your app
    - Postman collection or a req.http file with examples and instructions on **how to test all the endpoints** of your app
    - Software design (services architecture diagram)
- Programming style (6 pts)
- Proper use of http responses (2 pts)
- Proper handling of errors and exceptions (2 pts)
- Appropriate Clean Architecture Template use (6)
